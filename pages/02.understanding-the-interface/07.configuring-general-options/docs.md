2. Checking the _**Show document name under document thumbnail**_ option allows you to display the name of the document below its thumbnail in the _**Document Workspace**_.  By default, this option is checked. Your _**Document Workspace**_ will display the name of the document below its thumbnail. Unchecking this option will remove the names of the documents.
