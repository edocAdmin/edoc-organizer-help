D.Checking the _**Separate documents at blank pages**_ option will cause eDoc Organizer to analyze each scanned page to see if it is blank or not. Whenever a blank page is found a new document marker will be automatically placed on the next page to mark the start of a new document.

[notice]Note: eDoc Organizer automatically checks your scanners capabilities and shows only the relevant options for your scanner in this section.[/notice]
