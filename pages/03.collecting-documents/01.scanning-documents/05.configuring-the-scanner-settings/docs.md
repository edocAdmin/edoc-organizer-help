2.In the _**Scan Settings**_, you have 4 check boxes.

A.Checking the _**Use the scanner driver**_ option will use the default scanner driver installed for the scanner.

B.Checking the Use _**Automatic Document Feeder (ADF)**_ option will scan pages from your scanners ADF instead of the scanner's glass bed.

C.Some documents will have information on both the sides of the page. In such cases, you need to scan both the sides of the pages. Checking the _**Scan both the sides**_ option will scan both the sides of the page during scanning.

D.Checking the _**Separate documents at blank pages**_ option will cause eDoc Organizer to analyze each scanned page to see if it is blank or not. Whenever a blank page is found a new document marker will be automatically placed on the next page to mark the start of a new document.

 

Note: eDoc Organizer automatically checks your scanners capabilities and shows only the relevant options for your scanner in this section. The following is an example of the settings for a scanner that does not have an Automatic Document Feeder (ADF).
