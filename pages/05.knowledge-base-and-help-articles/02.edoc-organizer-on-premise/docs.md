# How can I migrate my eDoc Organizer Home Edition data to the On-Premise Edition?

**PLEASE NOTE: The migration utility only adds data to the on-premise edition. It doesn't delete the existing data. It is recommended that you delete all default Labels and Label Groups from the On-Premise edition before starting the migration process to avoid duplication. The easiest way to do this is to go to Tools > Configure Label Groups menu item in the On-Premise client and delete all existing groups before starting the migration process.**

1. Create an On-Premise account at [https://on-premise.edocorganizer.com/](https://on-premise.edocorganizer.com/)
2. Create a local backup from your eDoc Organizer Home Edition (File > Backup menu item). You might already have this part done.
3. Download and install the On-Premise Migration Utility from [http://www.edocorganizer.com/Downloads/eDocOrganizerOnPremiseMigrationSetup_1.3.0.exe.](http://www.edocorganizer.com/Downloads/eDocOrganizerOnPremiseMigrationSetup_1.3.0.exe.)
4. Use the Migration Utility to migrate the eDoc Organizer Home Edition backup created in step 1 to the On-Premise Edition.
5. Verify that the data has been successfully transferred to the On-Premise edition.
6. Activate On-Premise Edition on the new computer.
