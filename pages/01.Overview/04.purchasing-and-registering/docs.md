# On-Premise

Once you have downloaded the trial version of On-Premise, you can use that version for 15 days free of cost. You must purchase and register the product before 15 days to make sure that the trial version doesnâ€™t expire and you lose access to your valuable files.

1. To purchase your copy of On-Premise, navigate to [http://on-premise.edocorganizer.com](http://on-premise.edocorganizer.com) and click on "Buy Now." You can choose the $10/month subscription, or the $100/year subscription.
