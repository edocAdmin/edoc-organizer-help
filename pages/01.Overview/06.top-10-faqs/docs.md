# Top 10 FAQs

**1. Can I create sub-labels like sub-folders in Windows?

2. When I create a new label within a label group, it is placed on the top of the list of labels in that group. Instead of using Moving Down option, can I automatically place it in alphabetical order?

3. How do I selectively turn off OCR feature on certain documents?

4. How do I know the file name of a document stored in eDoc Organizer? How do I know the size of the document stored under eDoc Organizer?

5. Why can’t I find documents in eDoc Organizer using the text within them?

6. I created a Label Group using the configure label groups dialog and I don’t see it in the labels panel on the right hand side of the screen.

7. On the left side where it shows Labels and Filters, they seem to be out of order and wondered how I move them?

8. Why do some toolbar buttons seem to be disabled and not available? I want to merge PDF files, but the button is not enabled?

9. Where does eDoc Organizer store all its data on my computer?

10. How does eDoc store documents? More specifically, is there a proprietary format such that I will always need eDoc to view, edit and transport my data store or will I be able to open my files in Windows Explorer or some other compatible file manager?
