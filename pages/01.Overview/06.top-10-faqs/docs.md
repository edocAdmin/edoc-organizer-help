# Top 10 FAQs

**1. Can I create sub-labels like sub-folders in Windows?**

No. eDoc Organizer labels are very different from folders in Windows and so having many levels of sub-labels would not be ideal for organization within eDoc Organizer. eDoc Organizer helps you map a single document to several labels. So for example, when you scan a bill for Patient A in 2011, rather than storing it in a particular folder and then later trying to find which folder you saved it in, you simply apply the **Patient A**, **Bills**, and **2011** labels to it in eDoc Organizer. When you need to find a document, you can start by searching for the broadest category, let’s say **patient A**, and narrow it down until a few documents are shown on your screen. Then you can typically just pick the right one based on the thumbnails shown.

By intentionally preventing multi-level label organization, we are trying to prevent our users from falling into the same age old failed paradigm of organizing document by having folders under folders under folders and a particular file with a specific name. There is only one level of labels in eDoc Organizer and they are all the same. Each label defines an attribute of a document and together they give you a complete picture of what a document actually is. So, there is no redundancy, yet you have better organization and every document can be easily traceable.

**2. When I create a new label within a label group, it is placed on the top of the list of labels in that group. Instead of using Moving Down option, can I automatically place it in alphabetical order?**

**3. How do I selectively turn off OCR feature on certain documents?**

**4. How do I know the file name of a document stored in eDoc Organizer? How do I know the size of the document stored under eDoc Organizer?**

**5. Why can’t I find documents in eDoc Organizer using the text within them?**

**6. I created a Label Group using the configure label groups dialog and I don’t see it in the labels panel on the right hand side of the screen.**

**7. On the left side where it shows Labels and Filters, they seem to be out of order and wondered how I move them?**

**8. Why do some toolbar buttons seem to be disabled and not available? I want to merge PDF files, but the button is not enabled?**

**9. Where does eDoc Organizer store all its data on my computer?**

By default, On-Premise stores its database and document repository under **C:\ProgramData\eDoc LLC\eDoc Organizer\Documents**. You can change this option by opening eDoc Organizer Manager and choosing a different location. Cloud stores the documents on secure Microsoft Azure servers.

**10. How does eDoc store documents? More specifically, is there a proprietary format such that I will always need eDoc to view, edit and transport my data store or will I be able to open my files in Windows Explorer or some other compatible file manager?**
